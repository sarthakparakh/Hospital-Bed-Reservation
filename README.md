# Hospital-Bed-Reservation
Amid the ongoing COVID-19 second wave, the citizens of India were struggling to find
COVID-19 beds in their cities, we aim to create a real-time website which can help people to check
availability of normal, ICU beds and make a reservation (if beds available) sitting at home, rather
checking availability of beds physically in this ongoing situation.
